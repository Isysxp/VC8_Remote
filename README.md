# VC8_Remote<br>
<br>
This a simple VC8 display system for the PiDP8I for use with Spacewars (boot script 4).
The app is provided as a Windows project using Visual Studio (>2019) and includes the SDL system files.<br>
NB. In Visual Studio select x86 build and verify the runtime arguments.<br>
In addition the app may be run under Linux and OSX ... see VC8_Remote.cpp for further information.<br>
Usage: Boot the PiDP8I with the instruction field switches set to 4. Virtually all of the lights should flicker.<br>
Connect with ./vc8_remote <name of your PiDP8I> <-L>   -L switch doubles the screen size for high DPI displays.<br>
